# Bharat Intern DS Internship

Welcome to the repository showcasing my data science internship projects completed at Bharat Intern! During my internship, I worked on two exciting projects that provided valuable insights into the realms of data science and machine learning.

## Project 1: Titanic Classification Project

### Overview
Task 1 presented an exciting challenge: developing a predictive model to determine passenger survival likelihood aboard the Titanic. Leveraging Python and advanced data science techniques, I delved into historical data to analyze factors such as age, gender, and ticket class. The result? A robust model ready to navigate the seas of predictive analytics!
